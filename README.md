# 3D-Effect-with-CSS

In this code, we kinda create a 3D effect with only CSS.

We have 2 files.
 - index.html,
 - main.css.

In main.html, we only call our classes and the images of the Pikachu (Yes he is the cutest, I know).
In main.css, we gave the somewhat effect of 3D, and make our cute little Pikachu to a war machine.

Huge thanks to [Kevin Powell](https://www.youtube.com/@KevinPowell).

I'm sure you know him as the CSS king, but in case you don't, here is the link of his youtube channel:
